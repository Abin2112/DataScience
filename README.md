Data Science Practicals – Semester 6

This repository contains all practical work completed as part of the Semester 6 Data Science curriculum. It includes hands-on exercises on Excel, data preprocessing, machine learning algorithms, statistical analysis, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and data visualization. Each practical is implemented with clear code, explanations, and outputs for academic reference and real-world understanding.

1. Introduction to Excel

This section includes practical tasks demonstrating the use of Excel for data management and business analytics.

Conditional formatting on datasets using various criteria

Creating pivot tables for summarizing and analyzing data

Using the VLOOKUP function to retrieve information from other sheets or tables

Performing what-if analysis using Goal Seek to find required input values

2. Data Frames and Basic Data Pre-processing

This section covers how to work with datasets using Python and Pandas.

Reading data from CSV and JSON files

Handling missing values and outliers

Filtering, sorting, grouping, and transforming data

3. Feature Scaling and Dummification

Applying feature-scaling techniques such as standardization and normalization

Converting categorical variables into numerical features using dummification

4. Hypothesis Testing

Formulating null and alternative hypotheses

Performing hypothesis tests such as t-test and chi-square test

Interpreting statistical results and drawing conclusions

5. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)

Performing one-way ANOVA to compare multiple group means

Conducting post-hoc tests to identify statistically significant group differences

6. Regression and Its Types

Implementing simple linear regression
